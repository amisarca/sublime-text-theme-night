## About

Theme for [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/). It is inspired from the default theme, and also from the [Folder Icons](http://files.bernatfortet.com/labs/sublime/soda-icons/soda-folder-icons.zip) created by Bernat Fortet. 

## Installation

### Using Sublime Package Control

If you are using Will Bond's excellent [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), you can easily install Night Theme via the `Package Control: Install Package` menu item. The Night Theme package is listed as `Theme - Night` in the packages list.

### Using Git

Alternatively, if you are a git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo directly into your `Packages` directory in the Sublime Text 2 application settings area.

Go to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory and clone the theme repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/mishu91/sublime-text-theme-night "Theme - Night"

### Download Manually

* Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option
* Unzip the files and rename the folder to `Theme - Night`
* Copy the folder to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory

## Activating the theme

To configure Sublime Text 2 to use the theme:

* Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Settings - User`
* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "Night.sublime-theme"`

### Example User Settings

        "theme": "Night.sublime-theme"
    }
